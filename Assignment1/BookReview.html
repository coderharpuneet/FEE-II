                    <p> <b>Summary: </b>Stories of Struggle is a collection of accounts of some of the lesser-known
                        Civil Rights activists spanning from the 1930s to the 1960s in South Carolina.

                        her
                        research in 2003, Claudia Smith Brinson interviewed over 150 Black activists and their loved
                        ones so as not to let their stories be forgotten, nor ignored.

                        each
                        focusing on a different struggle toward equality, we meet many people who worked tirelessly and
                        against excessively difficult odds
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to
                        "launch the era of extreme racial changes” (Cecil J.
                        Williams). Part of the beauty of this book, is that the stories move in chronological order, but
                        can be read separately
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or
                        as a whole, and are “both intertwined and independent”.

                    <p> <b>Summary: </b>Arundhati Roy (born 1961) became an international sensation with the publication
                        of The God of Small Things, her debut novel, in 1997.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                        book won the Booker Prize, received
                        rave media reviews (thirty of which, from various newspapers and magazines, are quoted in the

                        copy before me), but has divided opinion. Many people see Roy’s book as a masterpiece, but a lot
                        of readers – or would-be readers who

                        it, unfinished and unloved – find it to be lacking
                        even the basics of telling a good story. I am very much in the camp of those enthralled

                        the
                        novel, but can also see the merits of the dissenting view.

                    <p> <b>Summary: </b>The Name of the Rose is plodding and complex. It does not have the pace of a
                        murder mystery and that’s because it’s actually much more of a historical novel <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than anything
                        else. Its first priority — far above entertaining the reader or advancing the plot — is to
                        situate itself perfectly in history, to merge so cleanly with <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the past that the reader can’t see
                        the seams. The Name of the Rose is obsessive in a lot of ways, beginning with its own
                        credibility.</p>
